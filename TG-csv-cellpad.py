# Script written for Windows environment since most DMR radios only have windows apps for codeplug manipulation. 
# Written by Ed, KE8TES
# This will work on all talkgroup lists to pad out the Talkgroup number to 7 digits for Custom network configuration. You will be asked to input the number you want as first digit while script is running.
# When creating this script I realized TGIF has some talkgroups with 7 digits already and some of those did not have 5 as their leading digit.
# so I pulled out those with 7 which did not start with the desired leading digit; saving them to error file so they did not corrupt your codeplug in case they were overlooked.
# I did not add header row to the output files as you typically are just pasting the files together anyway.
# Please use and modify as you see fit.
